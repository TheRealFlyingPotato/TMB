    * Health chips, give them a health stat boost to demonstrate stat dice
    * Make them melee, regardless of if they're ranged or not
      * give them a stat boost if needed - want to be able to move up 1, then roll 3 dice - 1atk+2def or 2atk+1def, whatever requires less changing
  * Initiative
  * work through their turn 
    * movement first
    * selecting what dice they want to roll all at once (atk and def)
      * cover dexterity here, how since they moved one it limits dice amount
    * select a target
